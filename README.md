Reworking my portfolio site into a simple, javascript-less static page

## Resources
- Non-JS dark mode toggle guide at [endtimes.dev](https://endtimes.dev/no-javascript-dark-mode-toggle/)
- Inspiration for non-JS single page dynamic site from... something I saw on HackerNews but didn't save a link for; I don't quite remember the resource I looked at for the `:target` pseudoselector, but generally searching for that will send you in the right direction!
- General conceptual inspiration from Jeff Huang's [Manifesto for Preserving Content on the Web](https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/)
